# Neural Character Engine

An interactive cognitive architecture sandbox that lets you watch a character's brain regions debate their next move. Configure the persona, feed a scenario, and observe how visual, emotional, memory, and executive systems negotiate a response. A baseline "Claude 4" style response is shown for comparison.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
2. Adjust the age, personality sliders, IQ, and trait selectors to craft a character.
3. Provide a narrative prompt inside the **Scenario** box.
4. Click **Run Neural Simulation** to watch each brain region speak in sequence.
5. Use **Randomize Persona** for inspiration or **Export Profile JSON** to save the configuration for reuse.

## Features

- Eight brain personas (Visual, Auditory, Anterior Cingulate, Amygdala, Limbic System, Hippocampus, Motor Cortex, Prefrontal Cortex).
- Real-time consciousness stream logging every neural utterance.
- Activity timeline graph visualising when each region spikes.
- Flow-chart overlay highlighting how signals move between the regions in real time.
- Persona randomiser and one-click JSON export for reusing NPC minds in other tools.
- Claude 4 style baseline response to contrast with the multi-voice cognition plus an integrative neural summary.

The simulation uses lightweight heuristics—no API calls or backend services—so it can be embedded in prototypes, game tooling, or design pitches with zero dependencies.
